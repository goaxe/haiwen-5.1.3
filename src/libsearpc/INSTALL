Basic Installation
==================

Libsearpc requires several other packages to be built. Before installing, read the `README` file and
MAKE SURE the required packages have been installed in your system.


1. If you downladed a tarball. Extract it to some path like `~/dev`, and cd ~/dev/libsearpc-1.0
   If you git-cloned it from the repo, just cd into the directory.

2. run the following commands sequentially:

   ./autogen.sh
   ./configure
   make
   make install

   Note that `make install` requires root privilege, for example `sudo make install` in Debian distribution.


Optionally compile pysearpc
===========================

By default, Pysearpc are compiled. If you'd like to not compile pysearpc, use the following command:

   ./configure --enable-compile-python=no

In this way, Pysearpc would not be compiled or installed.
 
In MacOs, if you want to use py2app, you would better run the following commnads:
   ./configure LDFLAGS="-Xlinker -headerpad_max_install_names"
In this way, the following error will be avoided:
   raise ValueError("New Mach-O header is too large to relocate")


Optionally compile demos
========================

By default, a pair of client/server demo programs are compiled. If you'd like to disable this, use
the following command:

    ./configure --enable-compile-demo=no

Note that whatever your choice is, the demos would never be installed. They just stay in the source
directory.

Other options
